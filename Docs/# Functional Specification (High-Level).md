# Functional Specification (High-Level)

This specification outlines the core modules (microservices) and their primary features.

## Module: Farm & Plot Management
*   **User Story:** As a Cooperative Manager, I want to register a new farm for a member, so I can begin tracking their agricultural activities.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A farm can be created with a name, owner, country, and general location. The system records a unique identifier, tenant ID, and timestamps.
*   **User Story:** As a Field Agent, I want to delineate the boundary of a plot on a map, so its exact area and location are recorded.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A plot can be created with a geospatial boundary (polygon). The system automatically calculates the area in hectares. Each plot must be associated with a farm.
*   **User Story:** As a Farmer, I want to view my plots on an offline map on my mobile device, so I can identify them while in the field.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Plot data, including geospatial boundaries, is synchronized to the mobile app for offline viewing.
*   **User Story:** As a Field Agent, I want to add a Point of Interest (e.g., a water pump) to a plot map, so its location is saved for future reference.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A POI with a name, type, and coordinates can be associated with a farm or a plot.
*   **User Story:** As a Cooperative Manager, I want to record the land tenure details for a plot (e.g., Owned, Leased), so we have a complete record of land rights.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A land tenure record can be created or updated for a plot, specifying the tenure type and other relevant details like lease dates.

## Future Modules (To Be Specified):
*   **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** User registration, authentication, authorization, role management, and multi-tenancy.
*   **Agricultural Practices:** Crop cycle tracking, activity logging (planting, fertilizing), yield recording.
*   **IoT Data Ingestion:** Receiving and processing data from on-field sensors.
*   **Geospatial & Imagery Analysis:** NDVI calculation, farm monitoring from satellite data.
*   **Communication Service:** SMS, USSD, and push notification management.
*   **Finance & Payments:** Mobile money integration, micro-lending workflows.
