# Project Overview

**Project Name:** Agri-Enhancement Platform (AEP)

**Vision:** To create a comprehensive, cloud-native software platform that empowers African agriculture at all levelsâ€”from smallholder farmers to large cooperatives. By providing accessible, data-driven tools for farm management, analytics, and financial services, AEP aims to improve efficiency, increase yields, and enhance economic outcomes in the agricultural sector.

**Core Principles:**
*   **API-First:** All platform capabilities are exposed via well-defined, secure, and versioned APIs to foster a rich ecosystem of clients and integrations.
*   **Modular & Extensible:** Built on a microservices architecture, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of features.
*   **Offline-First & Accessible:** Mobile clients are designed to function reliably in low-bandwidth environments. USSD/SMS interfaces provide access for users with basic feature phones.
*   **Data-Driven:** The platform integrates diverse data sources, including IoT sensors and satellite imagery, to provide actionable insights and advisories.
*   **Multi-Tenant & Secure:** Provides strong data isolation and role-based access control for various organizations (cooperatives, agribusinesses) and user roles.

**Target Users:**
*   Smallholder Farmers
*   Field Agents / Extension Workers
*   Cooperative Managers
*   Agribusiness Users (e.g., input suppliers, produce buyers)
*   Platform Administrators
